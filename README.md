# An IoT data processing frameWork based on Calvin with a flow update controller

## What is this?

A data processing framework for IoT that uses lightweighted actors and flow based programming concepts to communicate with each other.
According to the changes in network flow, the controller updates the routing flow between nodes dynamically by parsing the input actor application graph.

## Getting Started

1. Install Calvin files on all the nodes: https://github.com/EricssonResearch/calvin-base/tree/master/extras/install
2. Copy project files to each calvin install locations
3. execute $./start_csruntime.sh
3. execute $python Director.py from a single node with active csruntime
