# An IoT data processing frameWork based on actor model and flow based programming

## What is this?

A data processing framework for IoT that uses light weighted actors and flow based programming concepts to communicate with each other.
According to the changes in network flow, the routing flow between nodes are dynamically updated by parsing the input actor application graph.

## Getting Started

1. Install Calvin files on all the nodes: https://github.com/EricssonResearch/calvin-base/tree/master/extras/install
2. Copy project files to each calvin install locations
3. execute $./start_csruntime.sh
3. execute $python Director.py from a single node with active csruntime
